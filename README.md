# COVID Risk Calculator

The fundamental cannon of engineering ethics is to "Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public" [(1)](https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics). However, considerations of public safety, health, and welfare are not always black-and-white--they often require the engineer to weigh the risk versus the benefit of a course of action.  The purpose of this spreadsheet is to demonstrate how to apply conditional probabilities to calculate risks.  It demonstrates this using two examples: the risk of dying in a traffic crash, and the risk of COVID-19 exposure from participating in in-person activities.  In both, the user is encouraged to think about risk in a quantitative way, and to develop "An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts" [(2)](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/accreditation-criteria/criteria-for-accrediting-engineering-programs-2020-2021/).

The accompanying PDF document is written as a homework assignment suitable for an engineering class. You are welcome to adapt it for your own use.
